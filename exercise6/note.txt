TASK A
Q: Compare results from last week. How does disturbance affect Xenomai tasks?
A:	Xenomai isnt affected by the disturbance at all. This is due to the disturbance tasks being OS tasks, and 		Xenomai having priority over all OS tasks.

TASK_B
Q: Recall from last week - did any periodic pthread response thread have a predictable worst-case?
A:	Yes. The worst case was around 3k us, but i recall it should have been 1k us due to an error.
Q: With Xenomai tasks, has the worst-case come predictable?
A:	It is a little better at 0.9k us. There are a very few cases at 1k us too.
